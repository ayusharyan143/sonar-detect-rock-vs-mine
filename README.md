## Project Overview

- Dataset contains sonar signals with 60 numerical features each.
- Goal: Binary classification of objects into Rock (R) or Mine (M).
- Models used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest
- Logistic Regression was selected as the best performing model.
